#  Sales Data Analysis and Dashboard Project

##  Project Overview

**Welcome to my first significant Data Analysis project!** 

This project is a comprehensive analysis of a retail sales dataset, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) to drive business insights. The goal was to cleanse, transform, and model the raw data to create an interactive dashboard for effective decision-making.

**A note on my journey:** As someone currently stepping into the world of Data Science, this project served as a practical exercise to solidify my skills in data wrangling, advanced Excel, and data visualization best practices.

##  Key Features

* **Global KPI Calculation:** Deriving essential metrics like Total Revenue, Customer Count, and Average Revenue.
* **Time-Series Analysis:** Analyzing sales trends by year, month, and day of the week.
* **Product Performance Analysis:** Identifying top-performing and underperforming products/categories.
* **Customer Segmentation:** Analyzing sales by Age-Group, Region, and Gender.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** A single-page view summarizing all key findings.

##  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The following global KPIs were calculated to set the baseline for performance analysis:

| KPI | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Revenue** | $5,230,417 | The total monetary value of all sales. |
| **Total Quantity Sold** | $\mathbf{10,107}$ | The total number of units sold. |
| **Total Customers** | $\mathbf{107}$ | The unique count of customers. |
| **Avg. Revenue per Customer** | $48,882.40 | The average sales value generated by a single customer. |
